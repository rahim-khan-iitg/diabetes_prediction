# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a diabetes prediction model based on logistic regression. The model has an accuracy of 80%.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of the condition can help prevent complications and improve the quality of life for those affected.

Our model uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various risk factors. The model has been trained and tested on a dataset and has achieved an accuracy of 80%./
